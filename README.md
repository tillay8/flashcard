script:
- helps for memorizing scripts
- please take commas out beforehand idk how to make it not think commas are new lines
- might add cue lines later
- every time you get line wrong it will tell you another word in the line
- does not care about puncuation
- see mark antony for example script file

words:
- for learning other languages
- case DOES matter
- german articles are color coded (der is blue, das is green, and die is red)
- languages can be customized 
- direction can be customized
- words are stored in a csv, see words.csv for an example
- umlaute do matter (o ≠ ö)
- to practice cryllic characters download ru.csv and rename it to words.csv
most of these require a bash terminal, may change later idk
